<p>
  <i>8:00am</i> Normal day not a clear sky out but only a couple clouds. Shower, get dressed, do my morning scroll of
  Reddit.
</p>
<p>
  <i>8:55am</i> I work from home mostly so my commute is a 30 second walk to my home office. Turn my work laptop on and
  wait
  for my startup jobs to open everything I need for the day. Scroll more on Reddit.
</p>
<p>
  <i>9:00am</i> Join the standup meeting. While people are listing off what they completed yesterday and what their
  plans for
  today are, I hear my email ding and open my inbox.
<blockquote>
  We can't perform this key part of our business and we are totally hosed the whole day because of it. I can't believe
  you people have jobs since this program is so broken. You need to fix this NOW.
  -one of your kind and understanding clients
</blockquote>
We only hear from this customer every 6 months. I guess the broken software is tolerable for the other 182 days.
The fact remains we have a bug and it needs to be fixed.
</p>
<p>
  <i>9:30am</i> Did some preliminary poking around on standup and can see that yes it is a bug with our code. Create a
  work item for the bug and start looking into the issue.
  It takes me almost no time to reproduce the issue. It's a bad bug. Reporting completely incorrect numbers resulting in
  bad data being reported to our client's customers.
  I figure out easily what data is correct, suggest a work around to the client so they can continue their business and
  promise to get the bug fix out by the end of the day.
</p>
<p>
  <i>9:35am</i> Find the releveant code path and start tracing the code that could produce such a heinous result.
</p>
<p>
  <i>10:47am</i> I found it. Subtle but was a glaring problem. A line of code with an edge case that would rarely get
  hit and
  a
  bunch of terrible code around that line, taking the edge case from just that to a guarantee.
  I run through countless questions in my mind with increasing perturbation and confusion:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>How do I fix this?</li>
  <li>How long is this going to take?</li>
  <li>How did this get past peer review?</li>
  <li>How did this get past QA?</li>
  <li>How code such bad code get all the way to production?</li>
  <li>Who would write this code?</li>
  <li>What the hell were they thinking?</li>
</ol>
<div class="post-section-title">Sometimes I think about communication</div>
<p>
  As humans, we communicate all the time. The most obvious form of communication is verbal communication. Most people
  talk with others every single day, where it be with your boss, with your spouse, with your cats.
</p>
<img src="https://www.communicationtheory.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/shannon_weaver_model.jpg"
  alt="https://www.communicationtheory.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/shannon_weaver_model.jpg">
<p>
  These forms of communication fit the Shannon Weaver model of communication pretty well.
  In the Shannon Weaver model, there is an information source (Alice's brain)
  that encodes (turns thoughts into language) some message (what Alice wants to say) and transmits (speaks) that
  message through a channel (the air).
  Then that message gets decoded (Bob's ears turn sounds into thoughts) and then the destination (Bob's brain) receives
  the final message. When Bob responds to what Alice said, that is the feedback and now you have communication.
  Something else that is in this diagram is noise. This noise is depicted as only happening in the channel but it can
  happen in the encoder, channel, or the decoder steps as well (probably can happen in the sender and receiver steps too
  adding that idea into my thoughts doesn't change what I am about to say).
  This noise can come as a horn blaring from a car that is driving by or the letter you wrote got rained on and some of
  the ink smudged or interferrance in radio waves. Noise can also come from errors in the encoding and decoding process.
  If we think of compression algorithms as a communication channel (they have encoders and decoders and the result is
  only meaningful to a human before the encoding and after the decoding),
  if the encoder is written perfectly and the decoder clears the code table one iteration early, the receiver can't
  fully understand the result and the noise of this off-by-one error has completely disrupted the message.
  A similar issue can arise if Alice and Bob are having a riveting discussion about trees. Alice has only ever lived in
  Wisconsin around pine trees and oak tree (and she doesn't know much about any other trees).
  When Bob begins to describe a tree as a long single trunk that droops with long large branches that only come out of
  the very top of the tree and on those branches are a bunch of really long thin leaves, Alice will be pretty confused.
  She has never seen a tree like that, so the image of a palm tree can't form completely.

<div class="post-section-title">Sometimes I think about stories</div>
<p>
  In highschool, my least favorite subject was English class. I never understood why it was necessary to nitpick every
  detail of a book to pull understanding out of it.
  Why do we need to know exactly what the author is trying to say with this story? Was the pond in The Catcher in the
  Rye really a symbol of Holden's reluctance to transition from childhood to adulthood?
  Or was it just that ponds and parks are calm places that people use to clear their mind and exist in nature? Do any of
  these books really have any meaning?
</p>
<p>
  Of course these books have meaning. They have to. Their existance requires meaning. If you had nothing to say then why
  would you try to communicate it through a story?
  Authors attempt to communicate some message or messages by writing these stories onto paper such that someone or even
  themselves, can come back at a later time and experience the story and gain some message.
  The art of story-telling is interesting because you are using a variety of languages (written in books, visual in
  paintings, aural in music, combinations of several in movies and video games) to build up this message in another
  person's mind but the person isn't there with the artist as the artist is making it.
  This creates a broken model of communication where there isn't any feedback. It is all interpretation by the receiver.
  When people are consuming the art, the artist is absent.
</p>
<div class="post-section-title">Sometimes I think about artists</div>
<p>
  <i>10:47am</i> I realize these questions are ultimately unimportant. I could use git blame to see who did it but the
  only
  thing that matters right now is that I fix this bug so we can get a patch released.
  The fix was simple so I decided to spend a little bit of time and make the surrounding code better.
</p>
<p>
  <i>11:05am</i> The pull request is up, it gets approvals, QA verifies the fix, and we deploy that night to production.
</p>
<p>
  The rest of the day I think about The Catcher in the Rye. The artist took their interpretation of the requirements and
  encoded those thoughts into logic and then into a programming language.
  The compiler takes that code and encodes it into machine code for the computer to decode and do the work it needs to.
  Then when I received that bug to work on,
  I decoded the programming language into my own understanding of the current logic and compared that logic with the
  logic I encoded from the requirements.
  This is a massive communcation network with possibilities for noise to warp the overall message. Some areas we
  sacrifice that control for the purpose of time and productivity.
  Other areas we have a lot of control over. If the developer who created the code is no longer available because they
  got hit by a bus or won a million dollars, the artist is absent.
  If the developer who created the code is still available, you can communicate with them directly! Or can you? Software
  projects are constantly changing and as we develop these projects our experience has changed.
  There were some of those times where I couldn't hold back and I found I was the one who created the horrible code that
  caused loads of problems and headaches. Even if the same human is around, those artists too are absent.
</p>
<p>
  If the artist is absent, the only meaning that really matters is the meaning the artists that are not make. You can
  analyze the systemic issues that could possibly make someone make those decisions but any
  analysis on the past is warped by our new knowledge we've gained in the mean time.
</p>
<div class="post-section-title">Sometimes I think about mistakes and getting better</div>
<p>
  It is impossible to reflect on the past without it becoming warped with your new knowledge. I watched a conference
  talk about Three-Mile Island and how many times the engineers on call screwed up massively and how obvious these
  mistakes were.
  Then, after the presenter went through everything the engineers did wrong, they talked about how the report on the
  incident didn't take an approach of blaming and took an approach of understanding.
  The investigators put themselves in the shoes of the engineers. Instead of asking "What the hell were these folks
  thinking?", they asked "What lead them to believe they were doing the right thing?".
  This reframing of the question lead to loads of improvements to other nuclear reactors. They took something bad and
  worked on improving.
</p>
<p>
  When I find issues in code at work or code in my personal projects, I find I am constantly in this state where I can't
  talk to the person who wrote the code in the first place.
  Even comments in the code are affected by this noise and get stale. All I have is what I know now and the problem that
  needs fixing and the goal of improving.

  <li>
    These ideas were sparked by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N6y6LEwsKc">The Artist is Absent: Davey Wreden
      and The Beginner's Guide</a> where Innuendo Studios discusses the game
    The Beginner's Guide.

  <li>
    I don't know if this made any sense but I think about programming as an art, communcation, and human interaction
    through computers a lot.
