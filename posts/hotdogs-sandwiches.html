<h3>The Age Old Question</h3>
<p>
    This question has plagued philosophers, scientists, and food fans for millenia. Friends have become enemies. Bands have gone on indefinite hiatus. Blood has been shed over this age old question. 
    I, myself, have had countless debates with many innocent folks who just wanted to ask me this funny question. Little did they know, I take this question very seriously.
    People say this question is un-answerable and when they ask me they assume I am just another one of those normal people who have only a mildly held opinion on the matter.
    However, I don't just have a mildly held opinion, I have a strongly held <s>opinion</s> <b>FACT</b> with rebuttals to every edge case. The following is the outline for my answer to the question "Is a hotdog a sandwich?"
</p>
<h3>TLDR</h3>
<p>
    If you don't want to read this whole post (and you haven't figured out by the title), a hotdog is in fact a sandwich.
</p>
<h3>Dictionary Definition</h3>
<p>
    First thing people usually go for to answer this question is the dictionary definition of "sandwich". The usual definition they state is "two or more slices of bread with filling in between".
    However, the Merriam-Webster definition of a sandwich is a little more than that:

    <figure>
        <blockquote cite="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sandwich">
            <p>1 a. two or more slices of bread or a split roll having a filling in between</p>
            <p>1 b. one slice of bread covered with food</p>
        </blockquote>
        <figcaption><cite>"sandwich." Merriam-Webster.com. Merriam-Webster, 2023. Web. 11 May 2023.</cite></figcaption>
    </figure>

    This definition alone is quite damning and to me instantly convinced me that hotdogs are sandwiches. Note the part "<i>a split roll having a filling in between</i>". 
    Hotdogs are literally a split roll with a filling in between.
</p>
<h3>Okay but is a hotdog bun a roll?</h3>
<p>
    The Wikipedia article for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_bread_rolls">List of Bread Rolls</a> lists "Bun" as a term for a bread roll. Also, from the other direction,
    the wikipedia article for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_dog_bun">Hot dog bun</a> says "A hot dog bun is a type of soft bun shaped specifically to contain a hot dog or another type of sausage". 
    Most notably, in this definition when it mentions "bun", the article links to another article of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bun">bun</a>. In this article, it states "A bun is a type of bread roll, typically filled with savory fillings".
    So, we have "hotdog bun" implies it is a "bun" which implies it is a "roll". Since hotdog buns are notoriously split to fit the hotdog inbetween the buns, hotdog buns must be split rolls!
</p>    
<p>
    This conclusion along with the definition of a sandwich saying "a split roll having a filling in between" MUST imply that a hotdog is a sandwich.
</p>
<h3>Difficult Foes</h3>
<p>
    I have had to deal with many naysayers who call me crazy. Yet, even though they are claiming that I am the crazy one, they start denying the dictionary definition of a sandwich!
    They claim the sandwich bread must be completely split in two pieces thus the small connection of bread holding the two sides of the hotdog bun together causes the hotdog to be disqualified as a sandwich.
</p>    
<h3>A brief digression on Zeno's Loaf</h3>
<p>
    When does one go from "a loaf of bread" to a "slice of bread"? The term sliced bread came from the development of loaves of bread that were sliced by a machine for the consumer instead of the consumer themselves doing the slicing.
    The first prototype of a bread slicing machine was created in 1912 but was destroyed in a fire <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliced_bread#cite_note-Vorhees-4">citation</a></sup>. The first fully working machine was not finished until 1928.
    According to wikipedia, the modern concept of the sandwich can be traced to 18th century Europe but the use of a bread-like substance to lie under; under and over; or used to scoop up and wrap around food, long predates the 18th century.
</p>
<p>
    How can sliced bread be a requirement for a sandwich if sandwiches predate sliced bread? Obviously people can still cut off a part of a loaf of bread even if "sliced bread" doesn't exist.
    But, when does the bread lose it's loafness? If I cut a loaf of bread in half I would usually call them 2 halves of a loaf of bread. What happens if I cut a loaf of bread in half and give one of the halves to my neighbor?
    If they don't know about the existence of the other part of the loaf, does it make what they received still half of a loaf? Would they not refer to what I gave them a "loaf"?
</p>
<p>
    Maybe my answer lies in yet another dictionary definition:

    <figure>
        <blockquote cite="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/loaf">
            <p>1 a shaped or molded mass of bread</p>
            <p>1 a shaped or molded often symmetrical mass of food</p>
        </blockquote>
        <figcaption><cite>"loaf." Merriam-Webster.com. Merriam-Webster, 2023. Web. 11 May 2023.</cite></figcaption>
    </figure>

    A loaf that is cut in half is still shaped and molded and has symmetries (although the symmetries aren't a requirement based on the mention of 'often'). 
    What about a loaf cut in quarters? A quarter of a loaf still is shaped and molded so it must also still be a loaf. This logic is identical to Zeno's paradox where he will never reach the end because there will always be something to split.
    However, in our case it is Zeno's Loaf where he can't cut a loaf in half and get anything other than more and more loaves.
</p>
<h3>Returning</h3>
<p>
    The conclusions of the above section implies that any cuts we make will not change a loaf of bread to anything other than more loaves. So, the above implies that there is no such thing as a "slice" of bread and what we know as sliced bread is simply a small loaf of bread!
    This means I have created a sandwich if I take two loaves of bread and put a filling in between them! However, these debaters are implying that the two loaves is necessary for the sandwich since the hotdog bun isn't fully split into multiple loaves.
    This argument not only contradicts the dictionary definition but it also disqualifies many sandwiches from being sandwiches also causing a serious contradiction.
</p>
<h3>Hotdog sandwich denier contradictions!</h3>
<p>
    Contradiction one (1) comes from requiring two loaves of bread for a sandwich conflicting with definition 1b of the Merriam-Webster definition.
    This subset is the incredible "open-faced sandwich". An open-faced sandwich is a sandwich literally by name. This subset of sandwiches consist of a single loaf of bread with filling on top. 
    The contradiction is obvious since the two loaves requirement directly disqualifies all open-faced sandwiches from being sandwiches.
</p>
<p>
    As stated, there are many more sandwiches that become disqualified while requiring the two loaves. Consider the Philly CheeseSteak. This is undoubtably a sandwich yet the hoagie roll that contains the steak and onions and cheese is more often than not NOT completely separate loaves of bread.
    In fact, all hoagies suffer from this contradiction has they are primarily not completely split in 2. Falafels also suffer from this requirements as they have their filling packed into a pocket even so it is only split on 1 out of 4 "sides" of the loaf (if you imagine the circular loaf to abstractly be a square).
    Gyros are wrapped in a single loaf of pita bread. There are countless more examples from cultures all over the world of sandwiches that don't have their loafs' fully split in twain.
</p>
<h3>The Hoagie Gambit</h3>
<p>
    We briefly discussed hoagies in the last paragraph. However, if you find yourself in a debate about whether or not a hotdog is a sandwich, here is a strategy that will blindside your opponent causing them to concede the debate the second it is brought up.
    I call this strategy the "Hoagie Gambit".

<h3>Conclusions and Brief Thoughts of Other Food Classification Questions</h3>
<p>
    I hope these thoughts have given you some more understanding why a hotdog is a sandwich. My intellectual journey of food classification has been long and the end is not anywhere in sight.
    There are some ideas I have teased in the previous few paragraphs that have some serious implications. Also, there are even more meme questions about food classification (is cereal a soup?).
    Currently, I am working on a logical model that can be used as a tool for comparing and classifying any foods that people think are interesting enough to classify. 
    I am also hoping to make a complete compendium of the food classification heirarchy. 
    Since I am a programmer, I will make this compendium freely available on the web for all to access and gain this knowledge.
