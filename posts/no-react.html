    The site you are on right now is my personal programming portfolio website (which you probably knew if you are reading this).
    My first version of this site was created while I was graduating college and was just the start of me making my projects public.
    The goal was just something simple so I could use it as a portfolio for my upcoming job hunt. It was dead simple. 
    Just a couple html files and the only javascript was part of two interactive demos I made. 
    I also was focused on getting it done so I utilized Bootstrap for some basic components and css styling. 
    Overall, it was a fine site and very ugly (I believe my name was also misspelled on it lol). 
    On top of that, once I got my first programming job in November 2020, I had completely stopped updating it.

<h3>Lured in by Fancy Technology</h3>
<p>
    About 6 or 7 months ago, I decided it was time to give the site a face lift. But not just a face lift, I wanted to do things "the right way".
    So, I decided I needed to use ReactJS with TypeScript. I went through the process of setting up a TypeScript project with React but I also 
    wanted to use Bootstrap again because they had a nice assortment of fancy elements that I couldn't be bothered to recreate at all. However, 
    I also wanted the development experience to be super smooth so I needed to add Webpack into the mix to automatically detect changes on 
    the files I was editing and hot relaod my site that I was using in the browser. I also built out the CI/CD pipelines that ran webpack and 
    combined all the files into a package that deployed to a separate branch that Github Pages was pointed at. 
</p>
<h3>The Beginning of the End</h3>
<p>
    This setup wasn't easy to build out despite the super lax tutorials with 5 lines of configuration. Did I overcomplicate parts 
    of the setup? Almost defintely. However, I still found it extremely frustrating to follow these tutorials and have it
    not work because the tutorial was made 1 year ago and all the packages it uses are deprecated. I also had to deal with conflicting packages
    where I needed to install a particular package but found that a package I was already using brought with it the package I needed but the wrong version.
    So to solve it I had to uninstall one of the packages but that broke another package. 
    Again, it is very possible I was screwing something up but it was super difficult to learn what I was doing wrong. 
    These libraries are not documented that well and only have a really basic setup that was somehow too basic for this really simple portfolio site.
</p>
<h3>The Realization</h3>
<p>
    I did actually end up at a good spot with the React version of the site and I started really expanding. 
    I had some problems setting up those original interactive demos I had since React is pretty different from pure Javascript and I couldn't easily translate the demos.
    My solution for that ended up being using iframes and embedding a different Github Pages site that hosted only those demos.
    This is when the wheels in my brain started turning. I found it much more freeing to be doing this method of embedding the plain Javascript site into my React Typescript site.
    Then I started questioning "why even have React if I am just going to embed everything into iframes?"
</p>
<h3>The Goal</h3>
<p>
    After about 5 months (on and off in my free time) of building up this personal site, I decided to start over. 
    This time, I was going to use absolutely no external dependencies (except for one but not the one you would expect).
    I wanted to use solely HTML and Javascript. 
</p>
<p>
    No build system. 
</p>
<p>   
    No static typing. 
</p>
<p>    
    No state management. 
</p>
<p>
    Ultimately this is a dead simple site. I am not processing or displaying visualizations of millions and billions of datapoints. No complicated APIs that I have to interact with.
    I have no SLAs with customers. There are no other developers working on this site with me. I can really just do whatever I want. 
    I also really wanted to get a better understanding of CSS so I decided Bootstrap was no more. The only dependency I wanted to use was Font Awesome for a couple icons I wanted to use.
    Everything else is done completely by hand.
</p>
<h3>The Beginning of a new Beginning</h3>
<p>
    I am actually having a really fun time getting into the nitty gritty details of JavaScript and have refound my love of the language.
    Also, I really wanted to improve on my CSS skills and I feel like for the first time ever that I finally understand what I am doing.
    It is pretty amazing how removing the layers of abstractions and all these extra tools to make developer lives easier has actually made my life easier and has helped sharpen my skills.
    I still have a lot that I want to learn but I am actually feeling like it isn't some weird black magic "that just works" it feels like something manageable and something I can tackle.
