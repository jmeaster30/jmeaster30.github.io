  <p>Hello my name is John Easterday. I really like programming, art, computers, and cats.</p>
  <p>Programming topics I am interested in are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Compilers</li>
    <li>Generative Art</li>
    <li>Game Engines</li>
    <li>Office Applications</li>
    <li>File Formats</li>
    <li>Using code to automate my work</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The programming languages I really like (and because I like them I try to use them as much as I can) are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>C++</li>
    <li>C#</li>

  </ul>
  <p>
    Currently (August 2022), I am the lead developer of a small programming team working on medical billing software. We
    use C#, React, PostgreSQL and Azure for our tech stack. I have lead successful migrations (minimal downtime observed
    from customers and no lost data) from SQLServer to PostgreSQL and from on-prem IIS servers to Azure-hosted App
    Services (including blob storage for documents and azure functions for background processing).
