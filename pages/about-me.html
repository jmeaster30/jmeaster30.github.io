  <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
  <h3>Oracle - Software Engineer - July 2023 to Present</h3>
  <p>
    I am working on software that is used by hospital systems. 
    I mostly work on backend and a little bit of the Java SWT frontend. 
    Every few months, we do support rotations which involve performing releases of our team's products, 
    monitoring production environments for issues, and resolving bugs that need to be fixed. 
    The work I am most proud of was identifying and resolving memory leaks through analyzing heap dumps 
    and improving request performance through various methods.

  <h3>Medbill - Development Manager - May 2023 to June 2023</h3>
  <p>
    Managed the Site-Reliability Engineering, Software Engineering, and Quality Assurance teams. 
    Most of my responsibilities involved requirement gathering for main features,
    performing releases,
    monitoring the site and responding to issues that arise,
    designing and implementing architectural changes to our software, 
    designing and implementing new processes to increase productivity,
    making descisions around salary and hiring the right people for the job,
    and managing the team to make sure we had the resources we need and everyone is able to work effectively.
  </p>
  <p>
    I wasn't in this role for long but I worked on a plan to overhaul our QA processes and before 
    I left I wrote and recorded training lessons for all of the processes that I was performing and all 
    of the architectural work that I had not completed.

  <h3>Medbill - Lead Developer - December 2021 to May 2023</h3>
  <p>
    Managed the Site-Reliability Engineering and the Software Engineering teams. 
    My main responsibilities were requirement gathering for main features,
    performing releases,
    monitoring the site and responding to issues that arise,
    designing and implementing archiectural changes to our software,
    designing and implementing new processes to increase productivity,
    making descisions around salary and hiring the right people for the job,
    and managing the team to make sure we had the resources we need and everyone is able to work effectively.

    Also, I had some big projects that I was able to handle on my own. I implemented electronic claim submission with the EDI-837 and EDI-835 standards and interfaced with a clearinghouse so they could be submitted to insurances.
    This let our application submit a claim and get a response on the validity of the claim with a turn around time of seconds when our competitors had a turn around time of days.
    I migrated our on-premises app to the cloud for better reliability and scalability. This involved migrating from SQLServer 
    to PostgreSQL and this migration was successful with no loss of data and no downtime other than 
    the usual 2-3 hours for our deployments. Then I migrated from IIS to Azure App Services, this involved 
    setting up a testing environment and set up our Atlassian Bamboo deployment pipelines to make 
    sure everything could be deployed properly. This migration also only had the usual 2-3 hour downtime 
    that we usually had for deployments. Then we were moving from Atlassian products (Jira, BitBucket, Bamboo) to Azure DevOps.
    I migrated all the work items, code, and pipelines into the Azure DevOps set of products. 
    I also spent a lot of time optimizing and improving the release process so that the whole release process took 5-10 minutes with zero downtime for the end-user.
    There were some issues with our releases though. The first was that they weren't easily reversible in case there were issues with the release. 
    The other was this random glitch that happened when a user was using the site and had loaded the previous version of the site and tried to do anything a bunch of errors would be thrown up on the screen.
    This was very random though and the user would just need to refresh for everything to work properly again.
    These improvments to the release process let us go from releasing our code every couple months to releasing weekly and even every day if we needed.

  <h3>Medbill - Software Engineer - November 2020 to December 2021</h3>
  <p>
    My main responsibility was implementing features and bug fixes for a Durable Medical Equipment Billing software. 
    I had a few features/projects that I was really proud of. First, I worked on PDF and Excel Spreadsheet reporting 
    and I made a wrapper library for the OpenXML library that made it a lot easier to generate Excel spreadsheets that were not corrupted.
    I implemented electronic insurance verification using the EDI-270 and EDI-271 standards and interfaced with a clearinghouse so they could be submitted to insurances. 
    This let our users make a verification request and get a response in seconds instead of having to manually call the insurance which usually took about an hour.
    I converted our site's document storage from a file server hosted by our company into Azure Blob Storage. This let us scale our document storage much easier. 
    Involved in this, I wrote a tool that took all the documents from our local storage and put them into Azure Storage. 
    This initially took a few hours to only upload a couple thousand documents when we had nearly half a million documents across all of our customer environments. 
    So, I spent some time optimizing the tool and made it so it could upload 150,000 documents in 15 minutes. 
    I did this through just better database query logic, avoiding downloading the files locally first, and also through heavy use of parallelization.
    After some time, I also started managing/monitoring the site through IIS and managing the Bamboo build pipelines as well as running releases.
