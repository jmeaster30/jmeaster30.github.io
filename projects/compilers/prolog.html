                  <h4><u>Description</u></h4>
                  <p>This program is an implementation of Prolog that I made for my CS 1511: Theory of Computation class. For this project, we were allowed to choose from a list of projects my teacher gave us 
                     and this project was recommended for the graduate students who were taking the class. Even though I wasn't taking the class as a grad student, I was gravitated towards this project because I 
                     had been interested in the Prolog language for a while and I figured what better way to learn a programming language than create an implementation of it. Prolog is a super interesting language 
                     because rather than the program execution relying on step by step instructions to modify data, like SQL, Prolog programs are written by stating the relationships between data. Even though I couldn't
                     implement some of the features of the regular Prolog language it still works very well. I discuss my implementation in this 
                     <a href="https://github.com/jmeaster30/cs1511-prolog/blob/master/report.pdf" target="_blank">report</a>
                      that I had to write for the project. NOTE: I wrote the report in Latex and the code is included in the repository.

                  <h4><u>Improvements</u></h4>
                  <p>Since this was a project for a class, some of the code is not as clean as it should be. Notably, when I am comparing the query and fact trees there is a bit of spaghetti code to make sure the ordering
                      of the comparison is correct. Making this comparison order independent would improve the quality of the code significantly. 
                      A problem with the program that I wasn't able to figure out is getting repeated results when that result is found using two different facts.
                      Also, as stated in my report, I did not get the chance to implement the unbounded integers as a type of atom and implementing this would significantly shrink the size of the prolog programs. 
                      As you can see in my Towers of Hanoi example, I had to by hand code in the numbers and even though I only went up to 10 the numbers take up a significant part of the program. 
                      Implementing other mathematical operations on the integers would be cool too but it wouldn't be 100% necessary.
                      Another thing I wasn't able to implement but should include is lists. You might be able to implement lists by hand with the current system but I have not tried.
                      I also would like to experiment with other algorithms that are typically used in Prolog systems for the searching through facts. 
                      I tried implementing constraint-propagation but I was not able to do significant testing to make sure it works correctly.
