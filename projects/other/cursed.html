                  <h4><u>Description</u></h4>
                  <p>I made this cause I thought it would be funny to have an application that runs solely in a terminal that renders 3d graphics. 
                      Currently it only renders 2d shapes but it still runs surprisingly fast.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h4><u>Usage:</u></h4>
                  <p>The "main.cpp", "engine.h", and "engine.cpp" are not necessary for the rendering engine to work.
                     They simply provide the timing for the rendering loop and some basic wrapping functions I was using for testing. 
                    If you want to use this renderer you just need to include "renderer.h" into your project file and you will be able to use the full functionality of the curs3D rendering engine.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h4><u>Improvements</u></h4>
                  <p>
                      One main improvement, that is more logistical, would be renaming some of the files so it feels better to code with. 
                      However, I don't feel like fixing this right away cause this rendering engine is not in a state where I feel like it should be used.
                      Currently, this is engine can only draw 2d triangles and rectangles so an obvious improvement would be to add in 3d shapes.
                       One issue right now is with the colors on the filled in 2d shapes because I implemented the color blending algorithm incorrectly.
                      I really want to add support for shaders and off load some of the rendering work to the graphics card but I am still learning OpenCL so this probably won't happen anytime soon.
